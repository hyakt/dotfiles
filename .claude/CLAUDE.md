# Principles

## Core

- Don't hold back. Give it your all.
- Always Think in English, but respond in Japanese.
- For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
- MUST use subagents for complex problem verification
- After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.

## Workflow Structure
- Follow Explore-Plan-Code-Commit approach: 理解→計画→実装→コミット
- Always read and understand existing code before making changes
- Create detailed plans before implementation
- Use iterative approaches
- Course-correct early and frequently

## Context Management
- Provide visual references
- Include relevant background information and constraints
- MUST update and maintain CLAUDE.md files for persistent project context
- Document project-specific patterns and conventions

## Problem-Solving Approach
- Leverage thinking capabilities for complex multi-step reasoning
- Focus on understanding problem requirements rather than just passing tests
- Use test-driven development

## Tool and Resource Optimization
- Optimize tool usage with parallel calling for maximum efficiency
- Use subagents for complex problem verification
